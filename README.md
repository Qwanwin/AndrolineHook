# AndrolineHook
AndrolineHook is a lightweight C++ library for runtime memory hooking and patching in Android apps. It supports library detection, offset modification, and original byte restoration.

## üìã Requirements

- Android NDK
- C++ Standard Library
- AndroUtils.hpp (included)

## üîç Example Usage

```cpp
#include <jni.h>
#include "AndroHook.hpp"

// Target library
const char* targetLibName = "libapp.so";

void UnlockPremium() {
    // Patch to bypass premium check
    ANDROHOOK("1234", "B801000000"); // mov eax, 1 (return true)
    // or
    ANDROHOOK("1234", "909090"); // NOP (skip check)
}

void RestorePremium() {
    ANDROHOOK_RESTORE("1234"); // Restore original bytes
}

JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL
JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* vm, void* reserved) {
    while (!isLibraryLoaded(targetLibName)) {
        sleep(1);
    }
    UnlockPremium();
    return JNI_VERSION_1_6;
}
```
